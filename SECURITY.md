## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly. We appreciate your efforts to disclose vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner.

### üìß How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to **security@[your-domain].com** or create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainer directly at [mostafa.said7@example.com](mailto:mostafa.said7@example.com)

### üìù What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

#### Required Information
- **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the security issue
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity of the vulnerability
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of the software are affected
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue (if applicable)

#### Optional but Helpful
- **Suggested Fix**: Your recommendations for fixing the vulnerability
- **References**: Links to relevant security resources or similar vulnerabilities
- **Timeline**: Any constraints on disclosure timing

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Confirmation**: Within 1 week - confirm the vulnerability and provide initial assessment
- **Updates**: Regular updates on progress every 1-2 weeks
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities, 90 days for others

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using the Temperature Converter Console App:

#### Safe Usage Guidelines
- **Download from Official Sources**: Only download the application from the official GitHub repository
- **Verify Checksums**: Verify file integrity using provided checksums (when available)
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
- **Run with Minimal Privileges**: Don't run the application with administrator privileges unless necessary
- **Secure Environment**: Use the application in a secure, trusted environment

#### Input Safety
- **Validate Inputs**: While the app validates inputs, be aware of what data you're entering
- **No Sensitive Data**: Don't use the application to process sensitive or confidential data
- **File Permissions**: Ensure any output files created have appropriate permissions

### For Developers

When contributing to the project:

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Exception Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices for C# and .NET
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and review for known vulnerabilities

#### Development Environment
- **Secure Development**: Use secure development practices
- **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer
- **Static Analysis**: Use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues
- **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suite

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture

#### Low Risk Areas
- **Console Application**: Limited attack surface due to console-only interface
- **No Network Communication**: Application doesn't make network requests
- **No User Data Storage**: Application doesn't store personal or sensitive data
- **Mathematical Operations**: Core functionality involves safe mathematical calculations

#### Potential Risk Areas
- **User Input Processing**: All user inputs are validated, but edge cases may exist
- **File I/O Operations**: If file operations are added, they could introduce risks
- **Error Messages**: Care is taken not to expose sensitive system information

### Security Measures Implemented

#### Input Validation
```csharp
// Example of input validation implemented
public bool ValidateTemperatureInput(string input)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))
        return false;
        
    if (!double.TryParse(input, out double value))
        return false;
        
    // Additional validation for reasonable temperature ranges
    return IsValidTemperatureRange(value);
}
```

#### Error Handling
- **Safe Error Messages**: Error messages don't expose system internals
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application handles errors without crashing
- **Logging**: Errors are logged appropriately without sensitive data

## üîÑ Security Update Process

### How We Handle Security Issues

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test the security fix

#### üü† High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 14 days
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, significant data exposure

#### üü° Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 30 days
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, minor privilege escalation

#### üü¢ Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Response Time**: Within 2 weeks
- **Fix Timeline**: Within 90 days
- **Examples**: Minor information leaks, edge case vulnerabilities
